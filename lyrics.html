    <pre> Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rapping can they?
        Can they, Hop?
        I spit it through the wire, man
        It's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
        I'll gladly risk it all right now
        It's a life or death situation, man
        Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man
        It's your boy Kanye to the
        Chi-Town, what's going on?
        Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
        I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
        Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
        That right there could drive a sane man berserk
        Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
        How do you console my mom or give her light support
        Telling her, her son's on life support
        And just imagine how my girl feel
        On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
        She was with me before the deal she been tryna be mine
        She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign
        No use me tryna be lying
        I've been trying to be signed
        Trying to be a millionaire
        How I used two lifelines?
        In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
        The doctor said I had blood clots
        But I ain't Jamaican, man
        Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band...
